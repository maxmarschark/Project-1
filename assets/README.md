GO FISH!

The game I have chosen to create for my first project is Go Fish. I have changed the rules of the game a bit in order to have a fully functioning game. In this game there are two players.
Each player is deal 7 random cards. The object of the game is to have the most sets of 3 by the time the deck of cards has run out.

I used HTML, CSS, and javascript to create my version of Go Fish. It took me multiple tries to get to the point I am currently at. I had to start my game over multiple time due to design flaws.

I still have a few issues I am trying to figure out and hope to come back to at a later point. I was not able to have both players check hands. Originally I wanted players to be able to request cards from the other player but I was not able to get the functions properly working.
